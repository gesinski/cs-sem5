# Computer Science Semester 5   

This repository contains all the major coursework, assignments, and code projects I completed during the **5th semester of my Computer Science studies**.  
It includes practical implementations of algorithms, system administration tasks, compilers, database structures, and system-level software — demonstrating both theoretical understanding and hands-on skills.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized by subject area, each with its own folder:

- **compiler-construction/**  
  Projects and code related to building and understanding compilers and language parsing.  
  Includes lexer/parser code, grammars, and example programs.  

- **computer-system-administration/mail-servers/**  
  Scripts and configuration files used for setting up and managing mail servers on Linux systems.  
  Demonstrates practical system administration work.

- **database-structures/**  
  Implementations of core database concepts, data structures, indexing, how large files are sorted.  
  Includes examples and test cases.

- **system-software/**  
  Low-level software projects related to OS concepts, process control, memory management, and shell utilities.

## Technologies & Languages

This semester’s work spans multiple languages and tools, including but not limited to:

- **C++**, **C**  
- **Yacc / Bison** and **Lex / Flex** (for compiler tools)  
- **Python**  
- **Shell scripting (bash)**  
- Linux environment and system tools

## Highlights

### Compiler Construction
- Built lexical analyzers and parsers using *Lex* and *Yacc/Bison*.
- Handled syntax trees and semantic actions.  

### Computer System Administration
- Configured mail servers and automated system admin tasks.
- Worked with mail delivery agents (MDAs) and server security basics. 

### Database Structures
- Implemented efficient storage and retrieval algorithms.
- Explored indexing and data structure performance.  

### System Software
- Built utilities and learned OS-level programming.
- Worked with system calls and process management.
